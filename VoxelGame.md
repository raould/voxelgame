# Introduction #

Voxel Game is an early concept voxel game engine at an alpha testing stage. The engine currently does not include any gameplay, however the plan for the future is to incorporate a number of different gameplay ideas. Where we plan to be a bit different then most voxel games is that this wont be for infinite exploring and digging, but more in the direction of pvp and co-op tower defense type of games in a fully changeable voxel world.

Voxel Game has been written in C# .Net Framework 4.0 and OpenGL.
